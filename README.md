# KNN.Algorith-Rice
This program uses 3800 data points from Cammeo and Osmanick rices to classify new rice features using the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
The program provides a bar graph of 10 random data points for each feature, before and after normalization.
This application provides a convenient way to customize your new rice. On the main menu,
you can enter 1 to enter the features of your new rice, and enter 2 to view a menu diagram of all the features
